# 1. Give your robot a name
name: CI Pipeline - Build and Test

# 2. Tell the robot WHEN to wake up
on:
  # Wake up on a push to the 'develop' branch
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
  # ALSO wake up when a Pull Request is made TO 'develop'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop

# 3. Tell the robot WHAT TO DO
jobs:
  # This is the first job, we'll call it "build-and-test"
  build-and-test:
    name: Build & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use a fresh Linux computer

    # This is the "matrix" part of your project!
    # It tells the robot to run this job 3 times,
    # one for each Python version.
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11']

    steps:
      - name: 1. Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: 2. Set up Python (version ${{ matrix.python-version }})
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: 3. Install Pylint (our code-checker)
        #
        # run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        # run: pip install pylint
        
      - name: 4. Run Pylint to test code
        # We will also uncomment this line when you add code.
        # This is your "test" stage!
        #
        # run: pylint --fail-under=8.0 your_python_code_folder/
        run: echo "Pylint test step is ready." # A placeholder so the job passes

      - name: 5. A placeholder for a "Build" stage
        # Later, this step could build a Docker image
        run: echo "Build stage placeholder."

  # This is a placeholder for your "Deploy" stage
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build-and-test # This job WONT run unless "build-and-test" passes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: 1. Placeholder for Deploy
        run: echo "This job will deploy to staging/production later."
